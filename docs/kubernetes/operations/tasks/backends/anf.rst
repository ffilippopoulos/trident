Azure NetApp Files

.. note::
  The Azure NetApp Files service does not support volumes less than 100 GB in size. To make it easier to deploy
  applications, Trident automatically creates 100 GB volumes if a smaller volume is requested.

Preparation
-----------

To configure and use an `Azure NetApp Files`_ backend, you will need:

.. _Azure NetApp Files: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/netapp/

* ``subscriptionID`` from an Azure subscription with Azure NetApp Files enabled.
* ``tenantID``, ``clientID``, and ``clientSecret`` from an `App Registration`_ in Azure Active Directory with
  sufficient permissions to the Azure NetApp Files service. The App Registration
  must carry the ``Owner`` or ``Contributor`` role that's predefined by Azure.
* Azure ``location`` that contains at least one `delegated subnet`_.

Trident needs an App registration that permits the creation of ANF volumes. As
stated above, this will need to use the ``Owner`` or ``Contributor`` role that
Azure provides. To learn more about Azure built-in roles visit the
`Azure Documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles>`_.
Based on the backend configuration [subnet, virtual network, service level and
location] Trident will create ANF volumes on capacity pools that are available
in the requested location and match the requested service level and subnet.

.. _delegated subnet: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet

If you're using Azure NetApp Files for the first time or in a new location, some initial configuration is required that
the `quickstart guide`_ will walk you through.

debugTraceFlags    Debug flags to use when troubleshooting.
                   E.g.: {"api":false, "method":true}                               null
================== =============================================================== ================================================

.. warning::

  Do not use ``debugTraceFlags`` unless you are troubleshooting and require a
  detailed log dump.

.. warning::

  If you encounter a "No capacity pools found" error when attempting to create a
  PVC, it is likely your app registration doesn't have the required permissions
  and resources [subnet, virtual network, capacity pool] associated. Trident will
  log the Azure resources it discovered when the backend is created
  [``tridentctl logs``] when :ref:`debug <operator-customize>` is enabled.
  Be sure to revisit the :ref:`Preparation <azure_prep>` section and check if
  an appropriate role is being used.

Whether a backend's volumes will be mounted using NFS v3 or NFS v4.1 is a decision that must be made when defining a
backend or storage class.  The default is NFS v3, but you can use the ``nfsMountOptions`` backend setting to control
this choice. Just include ``nfsvers=4`` in the comma-delimited mount options list to choose NFS v4.1. Any mount options
set in a storage class will override mount options set in a backend configuration file.

You can control how each volume is provisioned by default using these options in a special section of the configuration.
For an example, see the configuration examples below.

================ =============================================================== ================================================
Parameter        Description                                                     Default
================ =============================================================== ================================================
exportRule       The export rule(s) for new volumes                              "0.0.0.0/0"
snapshotDir      Controls visibility of the .snapshot directory                  "false"
size             The default size of new volumes                                 "100G"
================ =============================================================== ================================================

The ``exportRule`` value must be a comma-separated list of any combination of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 subnets in CIDR
notation.

.. note::

  For all volumes created on an ANF backend, Trident will copy all labels present
  on a :ref:`storage pool <anf-virtual-storage-pool>` to the storage volume at
  the time it is provisioned. Storage
  admins can define labels per storage pool and group all volumes created in a
  storage pool. This provides a convenient way of differentiating volumes based
  on a set of customizable labels that are provided in the backend configuration.

Example configurations
----------------------

**Example 1 - Minimal backend configuration for azure-netapp-files**

This is the absolute minimum backend configuration. With this Trident will discover all of your NetApp accounts,
capacity pools, and subnets delegated to ANF in every location worldwide, and place new volumes on one of them
randomly.

This configuration is useful when you're just getting started with ANF and trying things out, but in practice you're
going to want to provide additional scoping for the volumes you provision in order to make sure that they have the
characteristics you want and end up on a network that's close to the compute that's using it. See the subsequent
examples for more details.

    {
        "version": 1,
        "storageDriverName": "azure-netapp-files",
        "subscriptionID": "9f87c765-4774-fake-ae98-a721add45451",
        "tenantID": "68e4f836-edc1-fake-bff9-b2d865ee56cf",
        "clientID": "dd043f63-bf8e-fake-8076-8de91e5713aa",
        "clientSecret": "SECRET"
    }


**Example 2 - Single location and specific service level for azure-netapp-files**

This backend configuration will place volumes in Azure's "eastus" location in a "Premium" capacity pool. Trident
automatically discovers all of the subnets delegated to ANF in that location and will place a new volume on one of
them randomly.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": 1,
        "storageDriverName": "azure-netapp-files",
        "subscriptionID": "9f87c765-4774-fake-ae98-a721add45451",
        "tenantID": "68e4f836-edc1-fake-bff9-b2d865ee56cf",

        "clientSecret": "SECRET",
        "location": "eastus",
        "serviceLevel": "Premium"
    }


**Example 3 - Advanced configuration for azure-netapp-files**

This backend configuration further reduces the scope of volume placement to a single subnet, and also modifies some
volume provisioning defaults.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": 1,
        "storageDriverName": "azure-netapp-files",
        "subscriptionID": "9f87c765-4774-fake-ae98-a721add45451",
        "tenantID": "68e4f836-edc1-fake-bff9-b2d865ee56cf",
        "clientID": "dd043f63-bf8e-fake-8076-8de91e5713aa",
        "clientSecret": "SECRET",
        "location": "eastus",
        "serviceLevel": "Premium",
        "virtualNetwork": "my-virtual-network",
        "subnet": "my-subnet",
        "nfsMountOptions": "vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600",
        "limitVolumeSize": "500Gi",
        "defaults": {
            "exportRule": "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.100",
            "snapshotDir": "true",
            "size": "200Gi"
        }
    }

.. _anf-virtual-storage-pool:

**Example 4 - Virtual storage pools with azure-netapp-files**

This backend configuration defines multiple :ref:`pools of storage <Virtual Storage Pools>` in a single file.
This is useful when you have
multiple capacity pools supporting different service levels and you want to create storage classes in Kubernetes that
represent those.

This is just scratching the surface of the power of virtual storage pools and their labels.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": 1,
        "storageDriverName": "azure-netapp-files",
        "subscriptionID": "9f87c765-4774-fake-ae98-a721add45451",
        "tenantID": "68e4f836-edc1-fake-bff9-b2d865ee56cf",
        "clientID": "dd043f63-bf8e-fake-8076-8de91e5713aa",
        "clientSecret": "SECRET",
        "nfsMountOptions": "vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600",
        "labels": {
            "cloud": "azure"
        },
        "location": "eastus",

        "storage": [
            {
                "labels": {
                    "performance": "gold"
                },
                "serviceLevel": "Ultra"
            },
            {
                "labels": {
                    "performance": "silver"
                },
                "serviceLevel": "Premium"
            },
            {
                "labels": {
                    "performance": "bronze"
                },
                "serviceLevel": "Standard",
            }
        ]
    }


The following StorageClass definitions refer to the storage pools above. Using the ``parameters.selector`` field, each
StorageClass calls out which pool may be used to host a volume. The volume will have the aspects defined in the chosen
pool.

    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: gold
