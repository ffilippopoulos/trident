Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page contains a list of known issues that may be observed when using Trident.

.. _2101-operator-bug:

* The Trident operator released with v21.01.0 contains an `issue <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/517>`_
  that has been identified with OpenShift Container Platform (OCP 4.x).
  Installations that are impacted by this issue will report this error:

  .. code-block:: console

    no kind ‘ClusterRole’ is registered for version ‘authorization.openshift.io/v1\’ in scheme ’k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api/legacyscheme/scheme.go:30.``.

  This issue does not
  affect the normal functioning of Trident, only the Trident Operator. This
  prevents changes made to the TridentOrchestrator custom resource (CR) after
  the install/upgrade from taking effect. **This has been fixed with**
  `v21.01.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v21.01.1>`_. Users
  are advised to bypass v21.01.0 and upgrade directly to v21.01.1 or later.

* A previously identified issue where iSCSI target portals with a
  negative group tag were ignored by Trident has been fixed with
  `v21.01.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v21.01.1>`_. This
  issue may be observed when ``iscsiadm`` reports target portals with a negative
  group tag such as ``-1``, as shown in the example below:

  .. code-block:: bash

    #List iscsi node records
    $iscsiadm -m node
    192.168.0.134:3260,-1 iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.6cffffffffffffffff5056b03185:vs.3

  Upgrading to v21.01.1 or later will fix this issue.

.. _igroup-bug:

* When using Trident `v20.07.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.07.1>`_
  for non-CSI deployments [Kubernetes ``1.11`` - ``1.13``], users may observe
  existing ``igroups`` being cleared of all existing IQNs. This has been fixed
  in the `v20.10 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.10.0>`_
  release of Trident. This can only be observed when Trident initializes a
  backend/restarts if scheduled on a new node. Users are **recommended to upgrade**
  to `v20.10 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.10.0>`_ or later.

* An upstream Kubernetes `bug <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/84226>`_
  that could be encountered when rapidly attaching/detaching volumes has been
  fixed with Trident `v20.07.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.07.1>`_
  and the
  `v2.0.1 <https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/blob/release-2.0/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-2.0.md#urgent-upgrade-notes>`_
  release of the CSI external-provisioner sidecar. Trident `v20.07.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.07.1>`_
  will use the ``2.0.1`` release of the ``external-provisioner`` sidecar for all
  Kubernetes clusters running ``1.17`` and above. If using Kubernetes ``1.16``
  or below, you must upgrade your Kubernetes cluster to ``1.17`` or above for
  Trident v20.07.1 to fix this issue.
* A previously identified `issue <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/430>`_
  with updating the storage prefix for a Trident backend has been resolved with
  Trident `v20.07.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.07.1>`_.
  Users can work with backends that use an empty storage prefix (``""``) or one
  that includes ``"-"``.

.. _fstype-fix:

* With Trident `v20.07.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.07.1>`_
  using the `v2.0.1 <https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/blob/release-2.0/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-2.0.md#urgent-upgrade-notes>`_
  release of the CSI external-provisioner sidecar, users will now observe Trident
  enforcing a blank fsType (``fsType=""``) for volumes that don't specify the
  ``fsType`` in their `StorageClass <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/>`_.
  When working with Kubernetes ``1.17`` or above, upgrading to Trident ``20.07.1`` would enable users
  to provide a blank ``fsType`` for NFS volumes. For iSCSI volumes, if you are
  enforcing an ``fsGroup`` using a Security Context, users are **required to set**
  the ``fsType`` on their StorageClass.
* Trident has continually improved the resiliency for iSCSI volumes.
  The `v20.07.0 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.07.0>`_
  release implements
  `multiple additional checks <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/418#issuecomment-666019020>`_
  that eliminate accidental deletions from occuring.
* Trident may create multiple unintended secrets when it attempts to patch Trident
  service accounts. This is a bug and **is fixed** with
  `v20.07.1 <https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v20.07.1>`_.
* When installing Trident (using ``tridentctl`` or the Trident Operator) and
  using ``tridentctl`` to manage Trident, you must ensure the
  ``KUBECONFIG`` environment variable is set. This is necessary to indicate
  the Kubernetes cluster that ``tridentctl`` must work against. When working
  with multiple Kubernetes environments, care must be taken to ensure the
  KUBECONFIG file is sourced accurately.
* To perform online space reclamation for iSCSI PVs, the underlying OS on the
  worker node may require mount options to be passed to the volume. This is
  true for RHEL/RedHat CoreOS instances, which require the ``discard``
  `mount option <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/discarding-unused-blocks_managing-file-systems>`_;
  ensure the ``discard`` mountOption is included in your
  `StorageClass <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#mount-options>`_
  to support online block discard.
* Although we provide a deployment for Trident, it should never be scaled
  beyond a single replica.  Similarly, only one instance of Trident should be
  run per Kubernetes cluster. Trident cannot communicate with other instances
  and cannot discover other volumes that they have created, which will lead to
  unexpected and incorrect behavior if more than one instance runs within a
  cluster.
* If Trident-based ``StorageClass`` objects are deleted from Kubernetes while
  Trident is offline, Trident will not remove the corresponding storage classes
  from its database when it comes back online. Any such storage classes must
  be deleted manually using ``tridentctl`` or the REST API.
* If a user deletes a PV provisioned by Trident before deleting the
  corresponding PVC, Trident will not automatically delete the backing volume.
  In this case, the user must remove the volume manually via ``tridentctl`` or
  the REST API.
* When using a backend across multiple Trident instances, it is recommended
  that each backend configuration file specify a different ``storagePrefix``
  value for ONTAP backends or use a different ``TenantName`` for Element
  backends. Trident cannot detect volumes that other instances of Trident have
  created, and attempting to create an existing volume on either ONTAP or
  Element backends succeeds as Trident treats volume creation as an
  idempotent operation. Thus, if the ``storagePrefix`` or ``TenantName`` does
  not differ, there is a very slim chance to have name collisions for volumes
  created on the same backend.
* ONTAP cannot concurrently provision more than one FlexGroup at a time
  unless the set of aggregates are unique to each provisioning request.
* When using Trident over IPv6, the ``managementLIF`` and ``dataLIF`` in the backend definition
  must be specified within square brackets, like ``[fd20:8b1e:b258:2000:f816:3eff:feec:0]``.
* If using the ``solidfire-san`` driver with OpenShift 4.5, make sure the
  underlying worker nodes use ``MD5`` as the CHAP authentication algorithm. Refer to
  :ref:`Worker node Preparation <iscsi-worker-node-prep>` for instructions.
