What is Astra?
##############

Astra makes it easier for enterprises to manage, protect, and move their
data-rich containerized workloads running on Kubernetes within and across public
clouds and on-premises. Astra provisions and provides persistent container
storage using `Trident`_ from NetAppâ€™s proven and expansive storage portfolio in
the public cloud and on-premises. It also offers a rich set of advanced
application-aware data management functionality, such as snapshot, backup and
restore, activity logs, and active cloning for data protection, disaster/data
recovery, data audit, and migration use-cases for Kubernetes workloads.
